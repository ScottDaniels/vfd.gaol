This repo contains support for building container images that
are useful or required for running VFd (Virutal Function daemon)
inside of a container. 

Directories:
	vfd - Contains necessary scripts and docker files for building
		a vfd image either from scratrch (fetching and building
		source from git repositories), or from a locally built
		copy of VFd. 

	tokay - Contains the source for the RabbitMQ interface process
		which allows a containerised VFd to receive requests via
		a message queue rather than from a local process. Also
		holds the needed container build information to create
		a tokay image.
