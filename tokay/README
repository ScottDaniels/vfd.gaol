When VFd is executing in a container, the preferred method for receiving 
requests is through a message bus. This allows the request process to 
reside on a physically different host than the VFd container enabling
centralised control of VF configuration as well as monitoring.

Tokay is a RabbitMQ listener which listens on a well known exchange for
VFd requests.  When a request is received it is wrapped in the json that
VFd expects, and written to the VFd request FIFO (usually in /var/lib/vfd/pipes).
When a response is received from VFd, Tokay wraps it into the published
Json format and writes it to the well known response exchange with the 
message key provided in the initial request. 

This directory contains the source code for Tokay, and the necessary
docker file(s) to build a Tokay image.  To build an image with tokay
execute the build.ksh script in this directory.  The resulting image 
should be listed by a `docker images` command, and should be less than
12MB in size. The image will be tagged tokay:latest.

The start_tokay_gaol.ksh script is a sample script which can be used to 
start a container from the Tokay image. It is only an example, and should
NOT be used for production.
